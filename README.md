# Obstacle-Avoiding-AI-bot
A self-playing bot built with NEAT-python for Chrome T-Rex game recreated in pygame

## Requirements
1. Python3
2. NEAT-python
3. Pygame

## Algorithm
We have used **NEURO EVOLUTION OF AUGMENTED TOPOLOGIES (NEAT)** for designing the AI-bot. NEAT is a very handy algorithm and is actively used in AI design. More information about **NEAT** can be found [here](http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf).

There is a great python library for **NEAT** in python developed by [CodeReclaimers](https://github.com/CodeReclaimers). We have used **NEAT Python** for implementing **NEAT** for the evolution of our AI-bot.
